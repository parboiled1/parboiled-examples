## Examples migrated

They now use [grappa](https://github.com/parboiled1/grappa).

## How to build

You will need to have a JDK (6 or higher) to build this package. Nothing else is needed.

Build with:

```
# Unix
./gradlew clean compileJava
# Windows
gradlew.bat clean compileJava
```

Alternatively, open with your IDE; all major IDEs support Gradle out of the box.
